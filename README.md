ZUnit is a powerful unit testing framework for ZSH

## Installation

> **WARNING**: Although the majority of ZUnit's functionality works as expected, it is in the early stages of
> development, and as such bugs are likely to be present. Please continue with caution, and
> [report any issues](https://github.com/zunit-zsh/zunit/issues/new) you may have.

### [Zinit](https://github.com/zdharma-continuum/zinit)

```sh
zinit for \ 
as'command' \
	atclone'./build.zsh' \
	nocompile \
	pick'zunit' \
	@zdharma-continuum/zunit
```

### Manual

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/zdharma-continuum/zunit.git
cd zunit
./build.zsh
chmod u+x ./zunit
cp ./zunit /usr/local/bin
```

## Writing Tests

### Test syntax

Tests in ZUnit have a simple syntax, which is inspired by the [BATS](https://github.com/sstephenson/bats) framework.

```zsh
#!/usr/bin/env zunit

@test 'example test' {
  # test logic
}
```

The body of each test can contain any valid ZSH code. The zunit shebang `#!/usr/bin/env zunit` **MUST** appear at the
top of each test file, or ZUnit will not run it.
